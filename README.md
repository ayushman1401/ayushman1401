# Hi there, I'm Ayushman üëã

üöÄ Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a passionate Electronics and VLSI Engineering undergraduate at IIIT-Delhi (Batch 2022‚Äì2026), deeply exploring the fields of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Cryptanalysis, and Computer Vision.
With a strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms and Systems Programming, I enjoy building efficient, scalable AI solutions and optimizing software performance.

I'm skilled in technologies like Python, C++, SQL, PyTorch, OpenCV, Flask, React.js, Docker, AWS, and more ‚Äî constantly pushing the boundaries between software intelligence and real-world impact.

Always eager to learn, collaborate, and create technologies that solve meaningful problems.
